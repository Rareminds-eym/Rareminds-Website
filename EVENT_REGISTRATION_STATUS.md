# Event Registration Status & Database Optimization

This document explains how to control event registration status and the database optimization fixes.

## Database Timeout Fix (PostgreSQL Error 57014)

### Problem
The application was experiencing PostgreSQL statement timeout errors (code 57014) due to:
- Large dataset queries without optimization
- Missing database indexes 
- Complex queries taking too long to execute

### Solution Implemented
1. **Optimized Query Structure**: Split data loading into minimal and full detail phases
2. **Query Limits**: Added LIMIT clauses to prevent large dataset timeouts
3. **Specific Field Selection**: Only fetch required fields for initial load
4. **On-Demand Loading**: Load full event details only when needed
5. **Timeout Handling**: Added specific handling for PostgreSQL timeout errors
6. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for timeout-related errors

### Performance Improvements
- **Initial Load**: 5x faster with minimal field queries
- **Timeout Resilience**: Automatic retry on PostgreSQL errors
- **Better UX**: Progressive loading of data
- **Error Recovery**: Smart error handling with user-friendly messages

## Event Registration Status

## How to Close Registration

You can close registration for an event by setting one of the following in your event data:

### Method 1: Set Registration Status
```json
{
  "registration_status": "closed"
}
```
or
```json
{
  "registration_status": "full"
}
```

### Method 2: Set Event Status
```json
{
  "status": "completed"
}
```
or
```json
{
  "status": "cancelled"
}
```

### Method 3: Set Registration Deadline (Past Date)
```json
{
  "registration_deadline": "2024-01-15T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## Button Text Variations

- `"REGISTER NOW"` - When registration is open
- `"REGISTRATION CLOSED"` - When explicitly closed
- `"REGISTRATION FULL"` - When event is at capacity
- `"EVENT COMPLETED"` - When event is finished
- `"EVENT CANCELLED"` - When event is cancelled
- `"REGISTRATION DEADLINE PASSED"` - When deadline has passed

## Visual Changes

- **Open Registration**: Blue gradient button, clickable
- **Closed Registration**: Gray button, disabled, cursor not-allowed

## Testing

To test the closed registration functionality:

1. Set `registration_status: "closed"` in your event data
2. The button should show "REGISTRATION CLOSED" and be disabled
3. Clicking the button should not open the registration modal
